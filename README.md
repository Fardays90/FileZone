# FileZone 

A fast, secure, **peer-to-peer** file sharing app built with **WebRTC**, **React**, and **Go**. No file is ever uploaded to a server â€” everything is shared directly between connected users inside a room.


-  Real-time file sharing via WebRTC DataChannels
-  Join rooms and share with multiple peers
-  no centralized file storage
-  Lightweight Go WebSocket signaling server

## How It Works

1. A user creates or joins a room.
2. The app establishes WebRTC connections with all other peers in the room.
3. Files are sent directly through P2P WebRTC DataChannels.
4. Recipients can instantly download the shared files.
